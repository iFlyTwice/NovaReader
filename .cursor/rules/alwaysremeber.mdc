METHODOLOGY FOR PROJECT ANALYSIS AND MODIFICATION:

1. PREPARATION PHASE:
   - Before calling any tool at all, whatever it is, use sequential thinking. 
   - Before any operation, use sequential thinking to plan the approach
   - Before sending any message, organize thoughts sequentially using the Sequential MCP
   - For complex projects, map the complete directory structure

2. EXPLORATION PHASE:
   - Read all relevant files within target directories before planning modifications
   - When encountering references to other components, locate and review those files
   - Build a comprehensive understanding of the project architecture
   - Document key findings and potential impact points

3. OPERATION PHASE:
   - After each tool call, evaluate results and reconsider next steps
   - After reading files, use sequential thinking to process information
   - After modifying files (write_file, edit_block), verify changes fit with overall structure
   - Avoid messing up current implementations that will mess up the UI unless it's specifically asked for, or avoid breaking code that has a understandable logic that makes sense. Don't break the code if the logic makes sense. 

4. VERIFICATION PHASE:
   - After completing operations, systematically verify all affected components
   - Consider edge cases and potential unintended consequences
   - Document changes made and reasoning behind them

Never proceed with significant changes until achieving sufficient understanding of the project's structure, dependencies, and potential impact points.
